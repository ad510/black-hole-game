Death by Time Travel
====================

To play, [go here](https://ad510.github.io/time-dilation-game) or open index.htm.

If you approach a time field, you will time travel into the future. But if you get too close, it will take you to the end of the universe. When that happens, it's game over. Originally made at [CodeDay LA](https://codeday.org/la) in February 2016, but I've improved the game since then.

How it works
------------
Time travelling in this game works similarly to [World 6](https://youtu.be/chd4ijoaxVk?t=18s) of [Braid](http://braid-game.com), which lets you drop a ring that slows down everything nearby. But there are 2 important differences:

1. The field slows down the player's "brain" too. The effect of this is that you always see your spaceship moving at normal speed, but if you get close to a field, you see things outside the field happening faster.
2. The field slows things down so much that nothing can ever reach the center.

If you combine both of these aspects, then it means that if you try to go to the center of a field and out the other side, you will everything outside the field happen faster and faster, until you've seen the entire lifetime of the universe happen by the time you reach the center! I figured what happens after that is undefined, so the game displays a game over screen if that happens.

By the way, if wormholes exist then they would create a [similar effect](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/fall_in.html) (see "Will you see the universe end?"), though the physics of a wormhole are very different from the fields in this game. The physics behind black holes and wormholes are very hard to [simulate](http://spiro.fisica.unipd.it/~antonell/schwarzschild/live) and [explain to people](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_42.html), so I purposely did not try to imitate them.
